DataCo Supply Chain Analysis

This project focuses on leveraging the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset from Kaggle

The dataset comprises supply chain data from DataCo Global, including transaction records, customer data, product information, and logistics. Key features include order IDs, product categories, quantities ordered, customer locations, payment methods, and more. This rich dataset provides a comprehensive view of the company's operations, serving as a foundation for our predictive models.

Key Dataset Features:

Orders: Contains over 180,000 unique order records, enabling detailed purchase pattern analysis and demand forecasting.
Unique Customers: Features a diverse customer base with more than 30,000 unique profiles, ideal for customer segmentation and personalized strategy development.
Products: Includes details on over 10,000 unique products, offering insights into inventory needs and product popularity.
Geographical Coverage: The data spans multiple countries, allowing for global supply chain insights and regional analyses.
Fraud Indicators: Contains markers for potential fraud, aiding in the creation of effective fraud detection models.
Rich Details: Offers comprehensive information on customer demographics and order specifics such as shipping methods and payment channels.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values were identified and handled appropriately. This may involve imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation, or dropping rows or columns with missing values depending on the context.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the given DataFrame revealed several key insights about the dataset. Here's a summary of the EDA findings:

Numerical Value Distributions:

Histograms and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots were used to visualize the distributions of numerical features such as 'Days for shipping', 'Benefit per order', and 'Sales per customer'. These plots helped in understanding the spread and skewness of the data.
Correlation Analysis:

A correlation heatmap was generated to explore the relationships between numerical variables. Strong positive or negative correlations between variables were identified, indicating potential associations that could be further investigated.
Categorical Value Analysis:

Bar plots were used to visualize the frequency distribution of categorical variables like 'Category Name', 'Customer State', 'Order Country', and 'Order Region'. This analysis provided insights into the most common categories and their distribution across different regions or states.
Sales Trend Analysis:

Monthly sales trends were examined by plotting the average sales per customer and the number of orders per month. This analysis revealed seasonal patterns or trends in sales over the months of the year.
Yearly Sales Trend:

Yearly sales trends were analyzed to understand how sales performance evolved over different years. Both the average sales per customer and the total number of orders were plotted to visualize the annual trends.
Overall, the EDA provided valuable insights into various aspects of the dataset, including the distribution of numerical values, correlations between variables, categorical value distributions, and sales trends over time. These insights can inform further analysis, modeling, or decision-making processes related to the dataset.

All of the EDAs are stored in image file for a better view and summary.

Here are three comparison questions along with the unit of analysis, the comparison values, and how they are computed:

Comparison Question 1:

Unit of Analysis: Customer Segments
Comparison Values: Average Sales per Customer
How They Are Computed: Calculate the average sales per customer for each customer segment. Then, compare these averages across different customer segments to identify which segment generates the highest or lowest average sales.

Comparison Question 2:

Unit of Analysis: Order Regions
Comparison Values: Total Sales
How They Are Computed: Sum up the total sales for each order region. Then, compare these total sales values across different order regions to determine which region has the highest or lowest total sales.

Comparison Question 3:

Unit of Analysis: Product Categories
Comparison Values: Order Profit per Order
How They Are Computed: Calculate the order profit per order for each product category. This can be done by subtracting the total cost of goods sold from the total revenue generated by each product category. Then, compare these order profit per order values across different product categories to identify which category is the most profitable.

The program is a Python script designed to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. It utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and seaborn library for data visualization. The program consists of several sections, each focusing on different aspects of EDA:

Numerical Value Distributions: This section analyzes the distributions of numerical features using histograms and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots.

Correlation Analysis: Here, a correlation heatmap is generated to explore relationships between numerical variables.

Categorical Value Analysis: Bar plots are used to visualize the frequency distribution of categorical variables.

Sales Trend Analysis: Monthly and yearly sales trends are examined using line plots and bar plots to understand sales patterns over time.

The output files generated by the program include:

Numerical_Value_Distributions.png: A visualization of the numerical value distributions.

Correlation_Heatmap.png: A heatmap showing correlations between numerical variables.

Categorical_Value_Analysis.png: Visualizations of the frequency distribution of categorical variables.(Cleats are sold the most, Peurto Rico has the most orders,Central America has the most no. of orders,etc)

Monthly_Sales_Trends.png: A plot showing the monthly sales trends.(October the most,January least)

Yearly_Sales_Trends.png: A plot showing the yearly sales trends.(2017 the most, 2018 the lest)

These output files provide visual summaries of the data exploration findings, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset.
